  <h2>Project Writeup</h2>

  <p>
    We have built an interactive MLB performance dashboard that visualizes both hitting and pitching data from 1970 to 2015. 
    For hitters, the chart shows AVG vs HR with OPS determining bubble size, allowing users to compare power and contact efficiency simultaneously. 
    For pitchers, the chart displays K vs ERA with FIP as bubble size, giving insight into strikeout ability and run prevention. 
    The interface includes filters for year, team, and pitcher role, along with hover tooltips and a click-to-view player panel summarizing key statistics.

  <p>
    The most challenging component will likely be managing visual clarity as more layers of interaction and filtering are added. 
    Baseball datasets contain large numbers of players per season, so avoiding overplotting while keeping all bubbles interpretable can be difficult. 
    Ensuring the panel, legend, tooltips, and controls remain readable and well-aligned across various screen sizes also adds complexity. 
    Balancing accuracy, performance, and visual simplicity while still presenting meaningful comparisons is the core design challenge.
