  <h2>Project Writeup</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>1. What have you done so far?</strong><br>
    I have built an interactive MLB evolution dashboard that visualizes how hitting and pitching have changed from 1970 to 2015. 
    The top charts focus on league-level trends such as runs per game, the rise of the three true outcomes (strikeouts, walks, and home runs), overall hitting quality via OPS, and pitching quality via ERA and FIP. 
    Era bands highlight the Expansion Era, Steroid Era, and Modern Era to contextualize changes in the run environment and strategy. 
    The decade-level bubble chart at the bottom summarizes how the “typical” hitter and pitcher changed by decade instead of showing a cluttered cloud of individual seasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2. What will be the most challenging part of your project to design, and why?</strong><br>
    The most challenging component is balancing statistical depth with visual clarity while telling a coherent historical story. 
    League-wide time series, era bands, and decade-level summaries can easily become overwhelming if too many encodings compete for attention. 
    Carefully choosing metrics like runs per game, OPS, FIP, three true outcomes rates, and decade aggregates is critical so that each chart contributes a distinct piece of the narrative. 
    The main difficulty is ensuring that users can connect macro trends, such as the Steroid Era power spike or the modern strikeout boom, with concise visual summaries without getting lost in dense or redundant information.
